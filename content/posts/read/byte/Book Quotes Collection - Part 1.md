<p>Books are an immensely valuable source of condensed knowledge and insightful thoughts. Here is a selection of my favorite quotes, from books I’ve read throughout the past years:</p>

<li>“No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge. <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> </li>
<li>By the time a student gets to college, he’s spent a decade curating a bewilderingly diverse résumé to prepare for a completely unknowable future. Come what may, he’s ready—for nothing in particular. (…) what could be a more appropriate reward for two decades of résumé-building than a seemingly elite, process-oriented career that promises to “keep options open”? <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
<li>The biggest battle I have is restricting their video game time because they want to play all the time. The rule is they have to read more than they play video games. They also can’t play completely stupid video games. There’s one game they downloaded recently called Cookies or something. You literally tap a fucking cookie. It’s like a Psych 101 experiment. I made them delete the cookie game. They had to play Flappy Golf instead, which is like Flappy <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>But I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth’s furthest dream, assigned to you when that dream was born, And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life, And to love life through labour is to be intimate with life’s inmost secret. <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></li>
<li>Promises are easy and cheap to make, actual work is hard and expensive. If it wasn’t, you’d just have done it now rather than promised it later. <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="business--companies">Business / Companies</h2>
<ul>
<li>Startups Are Easy, Stayups Are Hard <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
<li>On describes the earliest startup as like driving a race car. You’re close to the ground, and you feel every move you make. You have control, you can turn quickly, you feel like things are moving fast. Of course, you’re also at risk of crashing at any moment, but you only take yourself down if you do. As you grow, you graduate to a commercial flight. You’re farther from the ground, and more people’s lives depend on you, so you need to consider your movements more carefully, but you still feel in control and can turn the plane relatively quickly. Finally, you graduate to a spaceship, where you can’t make quick moves and the course is set long in advance, but you’re capable of going very far and taking tons of people along for the ride. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Most of the people at PayPal don’t understand this. The reason it worked was because the cost of transactions in PayPal was lower than any other system. And the reason the cost of transactions was lower is because we were able to do an increasing percentage of our transactions as ACH, or automated clearinghouse, electronic transactions, and most importantly, internal transactions. Internal transactions were essentially fraud-free and cost us nothing. An ACH transaction costs, I don’t know, like twenty cents or something. But it was slow, so that was the bad thing. It’s dependent on the bank’s batch processing time. And then the credit card transaction was fast, but expensive in terms of the credit card processing fees and very prone to fraud. That’s the problem Square is having now. “Square is doing the wrong version of PayPal. The critical thing is to achieve internal transactions. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Is this thing any good? Does it solve a real problem? Should we have made it better? Are we making what customers want? Is anybody going to buy this? Did we price it right? <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
<li>There’s only a bunch of business-axiom baloney like “If you’re not growing, you’re dying.” Says who? <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
<li>Tolstoy opens Anna Karenina by observing: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Business is the opposite. All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
<li>Are production incidents happening that are taking up lots of time? Are a bunch of people sick? Are they bickering over coding style in their code review comments? Are the tickets that are being written vague, too big, too small? Does the team seem upbeat in their communication style, sharing fun things as well as important work in chat, or are they purely business? Look at their calendars. Is the team spending many hours a week in meetings? Is their manager not doing 1-1s? None of these things are necessarily smoking guns, but they may point to an area to address. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Conway’s Law is often cited in discussions of this kind of structure. It states: “Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.” <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>As ridiculous and dangerous as this might seem, plenty of teams fall prey to the lure of status. These often include altruistic nonprofit organizations that come to believe that the nobility of their mission is enough to justify their satisfaction. Political groups, academic departments, and prestigious companies are also susceptible to this dysfunction, as they often see success in merely being associated with their special organizations. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Forget “minimum viable products”—ever since he started Apple in 1976, Jobs saw that you can change the world through careful planning, not by listening to focus group feedback or copying others’ successes. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
<li>Because let’s face it: Goals are fake. Nearly all of them are artificial targets set for the sake of setting targets. <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
<li>Start with a shared understanding of the goals, risks, and the questions to answer before making a decision. When you assign the ownership for making a <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>“We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.” <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup></li>
<li>You have 10 productive engineering weeks per engineer per quarter <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Dedicate 20% of your team’s schedule to “sustaining engineering.” <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>It’s likely that Q1 (immediately after the winter holidays) will be the most productive and Q4 (the quarter that includes winter and the end-of-year holidays) will be the least productive. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Therefore, you must always be aggressive about sharing estimates and updates to estimates, even when people don’t ask, especially if you believe that the project is critical or likely to take longer than a few weeks. This means you must be aggressive about getting estimates, and as we all know, software estimation is a very difficult process. Negotiating the process that your team uses to estimate, on what timescale, for what projects, may be part of your job at this level. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>If you haven’t taken the time to articulate the value of this work, it will get pushed aside in favor of projects that are more clearly valuable. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>My advice is to do your best to gather data to support yourself, and talk about what will be possible when the work is done. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>When an engineer comes to you with an engineering project that she wants to do, think about framing the project by answering these questions: How big is that project? How important is it? Can you articulate the value of that project to anyone who asks? What would successful completion of the project mean for the team? <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>The hardest part, in many ways, was getting started. The second-hardest part was getting comfortable making a guess about the future with highly imperfect information. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>“The key, of course, is to define our goals, our results, in a way that is simple enough to grasp easily, and specific enough to be actionable. Profit is not actionable enough. It needs to be more closely related to what we do on a daily basis. (…) By combining some and eliminating others, they narrowed them to seven: revenue, expenses, new customer acquisition, current customer satisfaction, employee retention, market awareness, and product quality. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="management">Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>The most important lesson I’ve learned is that you have to be able to manage yourself if you want to be good at managing others. The more time you spend understanding yourself, the way you react, the things that inspire you, and the things that drive you crazy, the better off you will be. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Contrary to the notion that teams waste time and energy arguing, those that avoid conflict actually doom themselves to revisiting issues again and again without resolution. They often ask team members to take their issues “off-line,” which seems to be a euphemism for avoiding dealing with an important topic, only to have it raised again at the next meeting. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
<li>Great teams ensure that everyone’s ideas are genuinely considered, which then creates a willingness to rally around whatever decision is ultimately made by the group. And when that is not possible due to an impasse, the leader of the team is allowed to make the call. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
<li>(…) dysfunctional teams that try to hedge their bets and delay important decisions until they have enough data to feel certain that they are making the right decision. As prudent as this might seem, it is dangerous because of the paralysis and lack of confidence it breeds within a team. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
<li>More than any other member of the team, the leader must be comfortable with the prospect of making a decision that ultimately turns out to be wrong. And the leader must be constantly pushing the group for closure around issues, as well as adherence to schedules that the team has set. What the leader cannot do is place too high a premium on certainty or consensus. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
<li>(…) the most effective and efficient means of maintaining high standards of performance on a team is peer pressure. One of the benefits is the reduction of the need for excessive bureaucracy around performance management and corrective action. More than any policy or system, there is nothing like the fear of letting down respected teammates that motivates people to improve their performance. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
<li>If the boss really wants to know what’s going on, the answer is embarrassingly obvious: They have to ask! Not vague, self-congratulatory bullshit questions like “What can we do even better?” but the hard ones like “What’s something nobody dares to talk about?” or “Are you afraid of anything at work?” or “Is there anything you worked on recently that you wish you could do over?” Or even more specific ones like “What do you think we could have done differently to help Jane succeed?” or “What advice would you give before we start on the big website redesign project?” <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
<li>A lack of engagement in meetings tends to mean the team isn’t engaged by the work or do not feel like they have a say in the decision-making process. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>But there is such a thing as artificial harmony, and conflict-avoidant managers tend to favor harmony above functional working relationships. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>The goal is to identify problems that are causing the team to work less effectively together and resolve them, not to become the team’s therapist. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Many of us believe that the way to be liked is to be seen as nice — that niceness is itself the goal. Your goal as a manager, however, should not be to be nice, it should be to be kind. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>It’s kind to tell someone who isn’t ready for promotion that she isn’t ready, and back that up with the work she needs to do to get there. It’s unkind to lead that person on, saying “Maybe you could get promoted,” and then watch her fail. It’s kind to tell someone that his behavior in meetings is disrupting the group. It’s awkward, and uncomfortable, but it’s also part of your job as his manager to have these difficult conversations. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Thinking about your actions is the best way to combat fear of conflict. Am I pushing this decision to the team because they really are the best people to decide, or am I just afraid that if I make an unpopular but necessary decision people will be mad at me? Am I avoiding working through this issue with my peer because she’s truly difficult to work with, or am I just hoping that the issue will resolve itself because I don’t want to have to discuss it and possibly be wrong? Am I holding back on giving my employee this feedback because he really was having a bad day and it’s just a one-off, or am I holding back because I’m afraid he won’t like me as a manager if I tell him? Be thoughtful about your behavior, and it’s unlikely that you’ll seek out unnecessary conflict. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>The real goal here is psychological safety — that is, a team whose members are willing to take risks and make mistakes in front of one another. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Your first goal is to protect your team as a whole, the second is to protect each individual on the team, and your last priority is protecting yourself. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Simply put, if your team member doesn’t respect you or her peers, why is she working there? <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>So at the end of another day when I feel like I didn’t write enough code and I have no way to quantify what I’ve achieved, I tell myself I was being as good a manager as I know how to be. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Project management. Onboarding new team members. Working with the product team to break down product roadmap goals into technical deliverables. Production support. These are all skills members of your team need to learn. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Even when you have been hired to fix a team, remember that the company has gotten this far because of some fundamental strengths. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Whether it’s QA, design, product management, or technical operations, ask lots of questions, but in an open way. Make it clear to the person that your goal is to understand what she does so that you’re capable of appreciating it better. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Sit in their meetings. Are they boring to you? Is the team bored? Who is speaking most of the time? Are there regular meetings with the whole team where the vast majority of the time is spent listening to the manager or product lead talk? Boring meetings are a sign. They may be a sign of inefficient planning on the part of the organizers. There may be too many meetings happening for the information covered. They may indicate that the team members don’t feel they can actually help set the direction of the team, or choose the work that will happen. They often signal a lack of healthy conflict on a team. Good meetings have a heavy discussion element, where opinions and ideas are drawn out of the team. If the meetings are overscripted, so that no real conversation can take place, it stifles that creative discussion. If people are afraid to disagree or bring up issues for fear of dealing with conflict, or if managers always shut down conflict without letting disagreements air, this is a sign of an unhealthy team culture. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>A bunch of people who never talk to each other and are always working on independent projects are not really working as a team. There would be nothing wrong with that if the team were performing well, but given that they’re not, this may be contributing to your problem. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Projects change. Teams may even be disbanded or moved around in ways that you don’t understand or agree with. As a manager, the best thing you can do is help people feel capable of tying up loose ends, stabilizing the current in-flight projects, and easing into their new work in a controlled fashion. This is an area where you can and should push back. Make sure that your teams get adequate time to finish up current work. Furthermore, push for engineering involvement in the early planning for the new work so that people can get excited about the projects they are moving on to. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>It’s not about being the lead engineer, chasing the latest language or framework, or having the shiniest technology. It’s about building a team with the tools and attributes to build the best possible product for our customers. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>You can’t give up the responsibility of management without giving up the power that comes with it. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Reach through the part of you that is shy about praising people or embarrassed to share your feelings, and go into the part of you that cares about the people you work with. You can share these stories in a way that is not forced or fake. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>(…) the larger the company, the smaller the team should be at the top. And with the addition of a new head of sales and a human resources director, her staff had grown to a barely manageable eight. It wasn’t that Kathryn couldn’t handle the weekly one-on-ones, but it was increasingly difficult to have fluid and substantive discussions during staff meetings with nine people sitting around the table. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
<li>(…) trust is the confidence among team members that their peers’ intentions are good, and that there is no reason to be protective or careful around the group. (…) Teams that lack trust waste inordinate amounts of time and energy managing their behaviors and interactions within the group. They tend to dread team meetings, and are reluctant to take risks in asking for or offering assistance to others. As a result, morale on distrusting teams is usually quite low, and unwanted turnover is high. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
<ul>
<li>Initially the technologists and the hippies did not interface well. Many in the counterculture saw computers as ominous and Orwellian, the province of the Pentagon and the power structure. In The Myth of the Machine, the historian Lewis Mumford warned that computers were sucking away our freedom and destroying “life-enhancing values.” An injunction on punch cards of the period—“Do not fold, spindle or mutilate”—became an ironic phrase of the antiwar Left. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Engineers frequently struggle with the transition to respecting and communicating well with diverse peers. I believe the struggle with respect is a side effect of the current tech culture, which tells us that engineers are the smartest people in the room. It can’t be said strongly enough: your peers who are not analytically driven are not stupid. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>“Engineers who graduated from MIT” is not a culture. “People who value technology innovation, hard work, intellect, scientific process, and data” might be. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>A lot of interviews try to determine cultural fit by what I would call “friendship” markers, such as “Would you like being stuck in an airport with this person?” <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>Furthermore, culture fit as determined by friendship tests is almost certain to be discriminatory in some way. Humans form friendships with people who have significant shared background experiences, and these experiences tend to closely correlate with things like schooling, race, class, and gender. The shortcuts you get by hiring friends are not usually the values you need to form a strong team. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="systems--processes">Systems / Processes</h2>
<ul>
<li>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>As your teams and systems grow, it’s almost impossible for any one person to keep the systems in her head. Because we have a bunch of people coordinating work, we evolve processes around that work coordination in order to make risks obvious. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
<li>(…) you should not put a complicated process on any activity where you want people to move quickly and where you believe the risk for change in that activity is low or that the risks themselves are obvious to the whole team. If you want to do code review for all changes, make sure that the process for code review is not so onerous that the team slows down significantly on minor changes, because that will impact your whole group’s productivity. The second implication is that you need to be on the lookout for places where there is hidden risk, and draw those hidden risks out into the open. There’s a saying in politics that “a good political idea is one that works well in half-baked form,” and the same goes for engineering processes. The processes should have value even when they are not followed perfectly, and that value should largely lie in the act of socializing change or risk to the team as a whole. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>

<li>But in effect it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. They remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister’s face, the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision.

<li>It’s lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for “realistic” goals, paradoxically making them the most time and energy-consuming. It is easier to raise \$1,000,000 than it is \$100,000. It is easier to pick up the one perfect 10 in the bar than the five 8s. If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself.

The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets. <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></li>
<li>Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></li>
<li>It takes a tribe to raise a human. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
<li>Sociological research has shown that the maximum ‘natural’ size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
<li>(…) for the craving for universal unity is the third and last anguish of men. Mankind as a whole has always striven to organize a universal state. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
<li>“What do you mean by isolation?” I asked him. “Why, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age—it has not fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For every one strives to keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime all his efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self‐destruction, for instead of self‐realization he ends by arriving at complete solitude. All mankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in his own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches by himself and thinks, ‘How strong I am now and how secure,’ and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he sinks into self‐destructive impotence. For he is accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and the privileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere in these days men have, in their mockery, ceased to understand that the true security is to be found in social solidarity rather than in isolated individual effort. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
<li>“Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule,” Nietzsche wrote (before he went mad). If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>

<li>(…) none of these things exists outside the stories that people invent and tell one another. There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
<li>“He who is abandoned is an abandoner,” <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
<li>The invitation read, “There’s an old Hindu saying that goes, ‘In the first 30 years of your life, you make your habits. For the last 30 years of your life, your habits make you.’ Come help me celebrate mine.” <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>

<li>Will they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them, and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story.

<li>What are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to do. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></li>
<li>The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></li>

<li>I define personal power as a state of mind in which a person is confident he can handle whatever may come. This kind of power not only successfully deals with problems, challenges and adversity, it actually welcomes them, meets them head on, and is thankful for them. Personal power isn’t the absence of fear. Even the most powerful people have fear. Personal power is the result of feeling fear, but not giving in to the fear. <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></li>
<li>“Comparison is the death of joy.” <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
<li>Yet the timeless in you is aware of life’s timelessness, And knows that yesterday is but today’s memory and tomorrow is today’s dream. <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></li>
<li>Men will even give their lives if only the ordeal does not last long but is soon over, with all looking on and applauding as though on the stage. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>

<li>“Men love the downfall and disgrace of the righteous” <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
<li>Goodness is one thing with me and another with a Chinaman, so it’s a relative thing. Or isn’t it? Is it not relative? A treacherous question! <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
<li>(…) “happiness and positivity is a choice,” the teammate who pooh-poohs every idea and criticizes everything is going to have problems fitting in. Sometimes, people will change to adopt the values. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>

<li>Ideological conflict is limited to concepts and ideas, and avoids personality-focused, mean-spirited attacks. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
<li>You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts; And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime. And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered. <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wealth">Wealth</h2>
<ul>
<li>And what follows from this right of multiplication of desires? In the rich, isolation and spiritual suicide; in the poor, envy and murder; for they have been given rights, but have not been shown the means of satisfying their wants. They maintain that the world is getting more and more united, more and more bound together in brotherly community, as it overcomes distance and sets thoughts flying through the air. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
<li>(…) yet to the very end he persisted in hoping that he would get that three thousand, that the money would somehow come to him of itself, as though it might drop from heaven. That is just how it is with people who, like Dmitri, have never had anything to do with money, except to squander what has come to them by inheritance without any effort of their own, and have no notion how money is obtained. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>

<h2 id="history--evolution">History / Evolution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is our own grandmother. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
<li>Women who gave birth earlier, when the infants brain and head were still relatively small and supple, fared better and lived to have more children. Natural selection consequently favoured earlier births. And, indeed, compared to other animals, humans are born prematurely, when many of their vital systems are still under-developed. A colt can trot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves its mother to forage on its own when it is just a few weeks old. Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance, protection and education. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
<li>Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
<li>It is unsettling – and perhaps thrilling – to think that we Sapiens could at one time have sex with an animal from a different species, and produce children together. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="religion--spirituality">Religion / Spirituality</h2>
<ul>
<li>“I think different religions are different doors to the same house. Sometimes I think the house exists, and sometimes I don’t. It’s the great mystery.” <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
<li>For even those who have renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being still follow the Christian ideal <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
<li>Freedom, free thought and science, will lead them into such straits and will bring them face to face with such marvels and insoluble mysteries, that some of them, the fierce and rebellious, will destroy themselves, others, rebellious but weak, will destroy one another, while the rest, weak and unhappy, will crawl fawning to our feet and whine to us: “Yes, you were right, you alone possess His mystery, and we come back to you, save us from ourselves!” <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="geopolitics">Geopolitics</h2>
<ul>
<li>“Every morning at six A.M., the first thing to hit my desk was this overnight report that included information on who got killed and what killed them,” O’Connell said. “I kept thinking, This is insane. Why are we in this place? It was not just Iraq but the whole picture. Why were we so invested in that part of the world?” The unsurprising answer that O’Connell came up with was oil. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Cowen’s future, huge gains in artificial intelligence will lead to the elimination of many of today’s high-employment lines of work. The people who thrive in this environment will be very bright and able to complement the machines and team effectively with them. As for the unemployed masses? Well, many of them will eventually find jobs going to work for the Haves, who will employ teams of nannies, housekeepers, and gardeners. If anything Musk is doing might alter the course of mankind toward a rosier future, Cowen can’t find it. Coming up with true breakthrough ideas is much harder today than in the past, according to Cowen, because we’ve already mined the bulk of the big discoveries. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
<li>If not, things will not improve by themselves. If you are kidding yourself, it is time to stop and plan for a jump. Barring any James Dean ending, your life is going to be LONG. Nine to five for your working lifetime of 40–50 years is a long-ass time if the rescue doesn’t come. About 500 months of solid work. How many do you have to go? It’s probably time to cut your losses. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<li>(Musk nearly died on a trip to Africa, where he caught a type of severe malaria. It was discovered late on his return to the United States, and Musk spent 10 agonizing days in intensive care. It took him six months to recover and lost 20 kilos during the illness.) “I came very close to dying,” Musk said. “That’s my lesson for taking a vacation: vacations will kill you.” <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
<li>“The guy comes in, and Elon asks him why they’re meeting,” Spikes said. “He said, ‘To develop a relationship.’ Elon replied, ‘Okay.
